	<h1> Toronto Raptors </h1>
	<p> I believe that the Toronto Raptors are the underdogs to win the title this year. Last year, Kawhi Leonard carried the Raptors to their first ever title. However, this year, he left the Raptors to join the Clippers, leaving many people wondering whether the Raptors would be able to defend their title. But the rise of all-star Pascal Siakam and many others led the Raptors to second place in the Eastern Conference. Many people have doubted the Raptors this season because of the absence of Kawhi, but they are proving everyone wrong. </p>
