	<h1> Houston Rockets </h1>
	<p> Just like the Raptors, I feel like the Rockets are another underdog to win the title this year. Led by James Harden and Russell Westbrook, the Rockets maintained a solid position in the Western Conference. Many people doubted the Rockets because of the absence of their star centre, Clint Capela, who was traded to the Hawks this summer. But just like the Raptors, the Rockets pulled through. </p>
