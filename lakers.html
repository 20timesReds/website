	<h1> Los Angeles Lakers </h1>
	<p> After the 2019 Free Agency, I think I can say that we all expected the Lakers to be a good team considering the fact that LeBron James and Anthony Davis have finally united. Together, they've taken the league by storm and have already clinched the first seed for the Lakers for the first time in many years. The Lakers could possibly be the new NBA Champions this year. </p>
