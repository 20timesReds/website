	<h1> Los Angeles Clippers </h1>
	<p> The battle of LA has been crazy this year due to the trades and signings both Los Angeles teams have made. The Clippers have signed superstars, Kawhi Leonard and Paul George and these aquirements have turned out well as the Clippers see themselves finishing second in the Western Conference. I am expecting an amazing battle of LA in the Western Conference Finals this year. </p>
